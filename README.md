### Inspiration
Finding student housing can be difficult a lot of the time, especially finding groups of people that match what you are looking for with similar living styles, as well as finding houses that have the right number of rooms/bathrooms and price range for rent. We wanted to find a way to make it easier for students to find both roommates and houses all in one place, and also make it easier for the landlords to keep track of who is interested in living in their house.

### What it does
The application is divided into two sections: "Roommate" and "House." In the "Roommate" section, users can swipe through profiles of potential roommates. These potential roommates are individuals who have indicated similar preferences and living habits. Users can read more about these potential roommates before deciding if they are someone they would be willing to live with. In the "House" section, users can swipe through potential houses that match their specified criteria and decide if it is a house they would want to live in. If a user likes a house and there is someone they liked in the "Roommate" section who also liked the same house, the application will suggest that these users become roommates for that house and book a showing together.

### How we built it
The app was primarily designed and built with a Next.js frontend and an Express.js backend. We divided the work between the frontend and backend, focusing on designing the user flow and defining the required user objects for our PostgreSQL database. These objects determined the API routes and the requirements for creating a user interface that was both visually appealing and engaging for users.

### Challenges we ran into
There were many features we wanted to add to this application, but having all the parts working within the 24-hour time frame ended up being challenging and we were unable to do a lot of what was in our plan for the application. Thus, time management was our biggest challenge, requiring us to prioritize the essential features of the app.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
This was our first hackathon project, and we are proud of our accomplishment to create an innovative solution, even if it didn't reach the full scale of our initial vision at the start of the event. We believe the idea is valuable and worth pursuing, which is another aspect we're proud of. It tackles a real-world issue drawn directly from our shared experiences, and we were able to conceptualize and develop a software solution for it, although incomplete. With additional time and resources, we are confident that we could expand and refine this project into something even more impactful.

### What we learned
Creating an application like this involves many complex components. Figuring out the connections between users and houses, and determining how to implement them effectively, is a challenging task that requires time and careful consideration. We realized that, in a fast-paced environment like this, itâ€™s often more practical to address edge cases as they arise rather than attempting to sort them all out during the initial design phase. This was a new and refreshing experience for all of us, and we are grateful for the opportunity to learn from it. Identifying our pitfalls has provided valuable lessons that we can use to improve in the future!

### What's next for Crib Crew
Sometimes, people already have a few individuals in mind they want to live with and are looking for additional housemates to join them. Implementing group profiles, where multiple people can be treated as a single unit searching for housing, is one of our future goals. Additionally, we aim to ensure that core functionalities such as logging in, managing user profiles, and enabling automated booking requests become integral parts of the full user experience in the future.
